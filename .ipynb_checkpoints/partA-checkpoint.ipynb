    "#\n",
    "# === Introduction ===\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this problem, you will build a planner that helps a robot\n",
    "#   find the best path through a warehouse filled with boxes\n",
    "#   that it has to pick up and deliver to a dropzone.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Your file must be called `partA.py` and must have a class\n",
    "#   called `DeliveryPlanner`.\n",
    "# This class must have an `__init__` function that takes three \n",
    "#   arguments: `self`, `warehouse`, and `todo`.\n",
    "# The class must also have a function called `plan_delivery` that \n",
    "#   takes a single argument, `self`.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Input Specifications ===\n",
    "# \n",
    "# `warehouse` will be a list of m strings, each with n characters,\n",
    "#   corresponding to the layout of the warehouse. The warehouse is an\n",
    "#   m x n grid. warehouse[i][j] corresponds to the spot in the ith row\n",
    "#   and jth column of the warehouse, where the 0th row is the northern\n",
    "#   end of the warehouse and the 0th column is the western end.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The characters in each string will be one of the following:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# '.' (period) : traversable space. The robot may enter from any adjacent space.\n",
    "# '#' (hash) : a wall. The robot cannot enter this space.\n",
    "# '@' (dropzone): the starting point for the robot and the space where all boxes must be delivered.\n",
    "#   The dropzone may be traversed like a '.' space.\n",
    "# [0-9a-zA-Z] (any alphanumeric character) : a box. At most one of each alphanumeric character \n",
    "#   will be present in the warehouse (meaning there will be at most 62 boxes). A box may not\n",
    "#   be traversed, but if the robot is adjacent to the box, the robot can pick up the box.\n",
    "#   Once the box has been removed, the space functions as a '.' space.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# For example, \n",
    "#   warehouse = ['1#2',\n",
    "#                '.#.',\n",
    "#                '..@']\n",
    "#   is a 3x3 warehouse. The dropzone is at space (2,2), box '1' is located at space (0,0), \n",
    "#   box '2' is located at space (0,2), and there are walls at spaces (0,1) and (1,1). The\n",
    "#   rest of the warehouse is empty space.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The argument `todo` is a list of alphanumeric characters giving the order in which the \n",
    "#   boxes must be delivered to the dropzone. For example, if \n",
    "#   todo = ['1','2']\n",
    "#   is given with the above example `warehouse`, then the robot must first deliver box '1'\n",
    "#   to the dropzone, and then the robot must deliver box '2' to the dropzone.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Rules for Movement ===\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - Two spaces are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner.\n",
    "# - The robot may move horizontally or vertically at a cost of 2 per move.\n",
    "# - The robot may move diagonally at a cost of 3 per move.\n",
    "# - The robot may not move outside the warehouse.\n",
    "# - The warehouse does not \"wrap\" around.\n",
    "# - As described earlier, the robot may pick up a box that is in an adjacent square.\n",
    "# - The cost to pick up a box is 4, regardless of the direction the box is relative to the robot.\n",
    "# - While holding a box, the robot may not pick up another box.\n",
    "# - The robot may put a box down on an adjacent empty space ('.') or the dropzone ('@') at a cost\n",
    "#   of 1 (regardless of the direction in which the robot puts down the box).\n",
    "# - If a box is placed on the '@' space, it is considered delivered and is removed from the ware-\n",
    "#   house.\n",
    "# - The warehouse will be arranged so that it is always possible for the robot to move to the \n",
    "#   next box on the todo list without having to rearrange any other boxes.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# An illegal move will incur a cost of 100, and the robot will not move (the standard costs for a \n",
    "#   move will not be additionally incurred). Illegal moves include:\n",
    "# - attempting to move to a nonadjacent, nonexistent, or occupied space\n",
    "# - attempting to pick up a nonadjacent or nonexistent box\n",
    "# - attempting to pick up a box while holding one already\n",
    "# - attempting to put down a box on a nonadjacent, nonexistent, or occupied space\n",
    "# - attempting to put down a box while not holding one\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Output Specifications ===\n",
    "#\n",
    "# `plan_delivery` should return a LIST of moves that minimizes the total cost of completing\n",
    "#   the task successfully.\n",
    "# Each move should be a string formatted as follows:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 'move {i} {j}', where '{i}' is replaced by the row-coordinate of the space the robot moves\n",
    "#   to and '{j}' is replaced by the column-coordinate of the space the robot moves to\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 'lift {x}', where '{x}' is replaced by the alphanumeric character of the box being picked up\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 'down {i} {j}', where '{i}' is replaced by the row-coordinate of the space the robot puts \n",
    "#   the box, and '{j}' is replaced by the column-coordinate of the space the robot puts the box\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For example, for the values of `warehouse` and `todo` given previously (reproduced below):\n",
    "#   warehouse = ['1#2',\n",
    "#                '.#.',\n",
    "#                '..@']\n",
    "#   todo = ['1','2']\n",
    "# `plan_delivery` might return the following:\n",
    "#   ['move 2 1',\n",
    "#    'move 1 0',\n",
    "#    'lift 1',\n",
    "#    'move 2 1',\n",
    "#    'down 2 2',\n",
    "#    'move 1 2',\n",
    "#    'lift 2',\n",
    "#    'down 2 2']\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Grading ===\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - Your planner will be graded against a set of test cases, each equally weighted.\n",
    "# - If your planner returns a list of moves of total cost that is K times the minimum cost of \n",
    "#   successfully completing the task, you will receive 1/K of the credit for that test case.\n",
    "# - Otherwise, you will receive no credit for that test case. This could happen for one of several \n",
    "#   reasons including (but not necessarily limited to):\n",
    "#   - plan_delivery's moves do not deliver the boxes in the correct order.\n",
    "#   - plan_delivery's output is not a list of strings in the prescribed format.\n",
    "#   - plan_delivery does not return an output within the prescribed time limit.\n",
    "#   - Your code raises an exception.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Additional Info ===\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - You may add additional classes and functions as needed provided they are all in the file `partA.py`.ipynb_checkpoints/\n",
    "# - Upload partA.py to Project 2 on T-Square in the Assignments section. Do not put it into an \n",
    "#   archive with other files.\n",
    "# - Ask any questions about the directions or specifications on Piazza.\n",
